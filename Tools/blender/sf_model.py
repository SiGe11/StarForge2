"""sf_model.py -- Blender authoring layer for StarForge model packs.

Run with the `bpy` PyPI wheel (`pip install bpy`, needs CPython 3.11); no
Blender install and no GUI are required. Nothing here is compiled into the
game: this is an offline authoring tool whose only output is
`assets/models.bin`, which the game treats as optional.

Two decisions worth knowing before editing this file.

**Everything is authored in game space, Y-up.** bmesh is used purely as a
geometry kernel and never as a scene, so Blender's Z-up convention never
enters. That is deliberate: converting Z-up to Y-up as (x, z, y) is a
reflection, and a reflection flips triangle winding, which the renderer's
`frontFacingWinding: CCW` + `cullMode: back` turns into an invisible model
rather than an obviously broken one. Authoring in the destination space means
there is no conversion to get wrong, and the dimensions can be lifted straight
from the primitives they replace in MeshGen.cpp.

**Materials live on faces, not parts.** Each bmesh carries an int layer naming
a row of `MATERIALS`, so a face can be inset and recoloured without splitting
it into its own object. The pack stores one palette per mesh and one index per
vertex, which is what keeps the file small.
